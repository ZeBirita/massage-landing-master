## Overview

This project is a frontend skills showcase. The business, brand, content, and contact details are entirely fictional and exist only to give the page realistic context. The focus is on clean, dependency-free frontend engineering: semantic markup, a modular CSS architecture, and progressive UI enhancements written in vanilla JavaScript.

## Highlights

- **Semantic HTML** structure across multiple, clearly delineated sections
- **Modular CSS architecture** — one stylesheet per section, with design tokens exposed as CSS custom properties
- **Modern layouts** using flexbox, CSS grid, and scroll snap
- **Fully responsive** with dedicated mobile breakpoints
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for all interactivity — no libraries
- **Scroll-triggered animations** via `IntersectionObserver` (fade-up, slide-in, scale)
- **Accessible FAQ accordion** with proper ARIA attributes
- **Interactive contact form** — inline validation through the `ValidityState` API, loading state, animated success state, and correct `autocomplete` hints (submission is simulated; no backend)
- **Adaptive back-to-top** — a floating button on desktop, a footer link on mobile
- **CSS-only tooltips** via `data-tooltip` and the `::after` pseudo-element
- **Theme-aware inline SVG icons** using `fill: currentColor`
- **Self-hosted fonts** via `@font-face` (no Google Fonts)
- **Performance-minded loading** — `<link rel="preload">` and `fetchpriority="high"` on the first slider image to eliminate load flash

## Getting started

No build step is required. Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve it with any static file server:

```bash
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server
```

### Running with Docker

```bash
make build   # builds the image as massage-landing
make run     # runs the container at http://localhost:8080
make stop    # stops the running container
```

Or without Make:

```bash
docker build -t massage-landing .
docker run --rm --name massage-website -d -p 8080:80 massage-landing
docker stop massage-website
```

The image is based on `nginx:alpine` and serves the static files directly — no application runtime is needed.
